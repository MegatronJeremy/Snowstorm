# Megatron Game Engine

Next generation Vulkan game engine.

There are three included projects - __Core__, __App__ and __Editor__. __CMake__ in conjunction with __Conan2__ is used to generate project files.

Core builds into a static library and is meant to contain common code intended for use in multiple applications. 
App and Editor build into an executable and link the Core static library, as well as having an include path to Core's code.

The `Scripts/` directory contains a generate solution script for a Visual Studio solution file, as well as a build script.
